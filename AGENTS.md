## Design Philosophy

**Only build skills for things models don't already know.** Claude is already good at writing code, explaining concepts, and general problem-solving. Skills should encode:

- **Procedural knowledge** — multi-step workflows that require specific ordering
- **Decision trees** — when to choose X over Y based on situational factors
- **Reference material** — API surfaces, Unicode catalogs, framework-specific patterns
- **Hard-won patterns** — gotchas, anti-patterns, and real-world failure modes

If the model can already do it well without guidance, don't write a skill for it.

## Adding a New Skill

### Step 1: Create the Directory

```bash
mkdir -p skills/<skill-name>
touch skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Add `references/` only if the skill needs detailed reference material that would bloat the main SKILL.md beyond ~3,000 words:

```bash
mkdir -p skills/<skill-name>/references
```

### Step 2: Write SKILL.md

Every SKILL.md has two parts: YAML frontmatter and markdown body.

#### Frontmatter (Required)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Use this skill when [specific triggers]. Activates on mentions of [keyword1], [keyword2], [keyword3], or [keyword4].
---
```

**Description rules:**
- Start with "Use this skill when" followed by concrete scenarios
- Include "Activates on mentions of" with specific trigger words/phrases
- Be generous with triggers — list 8-12 keywords that should activate the skill
- Include both formal terms ("threat modeling") and casual phrasing ("security review")

**Good example:**
```yaml
description: Use this skill for complex git operations including rebases, merge conflict resolution, cherry-picking, branch management, or repository archaeology. Activates on mentions of git rebase, merge conflict, cherry-pick, git history, branch cleanup, git bisect, worktree, force push, or complex git operations.
```

**Bad example:**
```yaml
description: Helps with git stuff.
```

#### Body Structure

The body is what Claude reads when the skill triggers. Structure it for fast scanning:

```markdown
# Skill Title

One-paragraph summary of what this skill provides and its core insight.

## Section 1: [Core Content]

Tables, decision trees, and procedures. Prefer tables over prose:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| X         | Do Y   |
| Z         | Do W   |

## Section 2: [More Content]

...

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| Common mistake | How to avoid it |

## What This Skill is NOT

- Not a replacement for [X]
- Not required for [Y]
```

**Body guidelines:**
- Target 1,500-3,000 words. Move anything beyond that to `references/`
- Use tables over prose — they scan faster and waste fewer tokens
- Include decision trees for branching logic
- Add anti-pattern tables — knowing what NOT to do is as valuable as knowing what to do
- End with "What This Skill is NOT" to prevent misuse
- Flowcharts use Graphviz `dot` format in fenced code blocks (```dot)

### Step 3: Add Reference Files (Optional)

For skills with extensive reference material, use progressive disclosure:

```
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Core procedures (~2,000 words)
└── references/
    ├── api-reference.md        # Full API surface
    ├── patterns.md             # Advanced patterns
    └── visual-catalog.md       # Lookup tables, catalogs
```

**Reference files:**
- No YAML frontmatter needed — just plain markdown
- Can be large (2,000-10,000+ words)
- Only loaded into context when Claude determines it needs them
- Must be referenced from SKILL.md so Claude knows they exist

**Reference from SKILL.md like this:**
```markdown
## References

For detailed API documentation, consult `references/api-reference.md`.
For advanced configuration patterns, see `references/patterns.md`.
```

**When to use references vs inline:**

| Content Type | Where |
|-------------|-------|
| Core workflow steps | SKILL.md body |
| Decision trees | SKILL.md body |
| Quick-reference tables | SKILL.md body |
| Anti-patterns | SKILL.md body |
| Full API surfaces | `references/` |
| Unicode/visual catalogs | `references/` |
| Advanced patterns (>20 entries) | `references/` |
| Real-world app galleries | `references/` |

### Step 4: Update Plugin Metadata

After creating the skill, update these files:

#### `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

Add relevant keywords to the `keywords` array:

```json
{
  "keywords": [
    "existing-keyword",
    "new-skill-keyword-1",
    "new-skill-keyword-2"
  ]
}
```

Bump the version following semver:
- New skill = minor version bump (e.g., 3.0.0 → 3.1.0)
- Skill content update = patch bump (e.g., 3.1.0 → 3.1.1)
- Breaking changes (rename/remove skill) = major bump

#### `CLAUDE.md`

Add an install command:

```bash
npx skills add hyperbliss/hyperskills --skill <skill-name>
```

Add a skill description section:

```markdown
### Skill Title (`hyperskills:<skill-name>`)

One-sentence description of what it provides.
```

Add to the usage section:

```bash
/hyperskills:<skill-name>
```

### Step 5: Validate

Before committing, verify:

- [ ] `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Frontmatter has both `name` and `description` fields
- [ ] Description includes specific trigger phrases (8-12 keywords)
- [ ] Body is under 5,000 words (ideally 1,500-3,000)
- [ ] All files referenced from SKILL.md actually exist
- [ ] No duplicate content between SKILL.md and reference files
- [ ] Tables used instead of prose where possible
- [ ] Anti-patterns section included
- [ ] "What This Skill is NOT" section included
- [ ] `plugin.json` keywords updated
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` updated with install command, description, and usage
- [ ] Version bumped in `plugin.json`

## Existing Skill Inventory

| Skill | Tokens | References | Domain |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| `brainstorm` | ~2,500 | none | Process — ideation |
| `plan` | ~2,800 | none | Process — decomposition |
| `research` | ~3,200 | none | Process — knowledge gathering |
| `orchestrate` | ~4,000 | none | Process — multi-agent dispatch |
| `security` | ~1,500 | none | Domain — security ops |
| `git` | ~1,200 | none | Domain — git operations |
| `tilt` | ~2,500 | 2 files | Domain — Kubernetes dev |
| `tui-design` | ~3,000 | 2 files | Domain — terminal UI |
| `codex-review` | ~2,000 | 1 file | Process — cross-model review |
| `implement` | ~2,500 | 1 file | Process — implementation |

## Skill Categories

When adding a new skill, it should fit one of these categories:

**Process skills** — HOW to approach a class of work:
- `brainstorm`, `plan`, `research`, `orchestrate`, `codex-review`, `implement`
- These tend to be workflow-heavy with phases and decision gates

**Domain skills** — specialized knowledge for a specific technology or practice:
- `security`, `git`, `tilt`, `tui-design`
- These tend to be reference-heavy with decision trees and lookup tables

## Writing Style

- **Imperative form:** "Search Sibyl first" not "You should search Sibyl first"
- **Tables over prose:** Decision trees, comparisons, and reference data in table format
- **Graphviz for flows:** Use ```dot fenced code blocks for process diagrams
- **Concrete over abstract:** "Run `git rebase origin/main`" not "rebase your branch"
- **Date volatile info:** "As of Feb 2026" — skills spoil like research
- **No fluff:** Every sentence should teach something or guide a decision

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Vague description with no trigger words | Add 8-12 specific keywords after "Activates on mentions of" |
| Entire skill is >5,000 words in SKILL.md | Split into SKILL.md (core) + references/ (detail) |
| Prose paragraphs explaining options | Convert to decision tree tables |
| Duplicating what models already know | Only encode non-obvious procedural knowledge |
| No anti-patterns section | Add one — knowing pitfalls is half the value |
| Missing "What This Skill is NOT" | Add scope boundaries to prevent misuse |
| Reference files exist but aren't mentioned in SKILL.md | Add a References section pointing to them |
| Forgetting to update plugin.json and CLAUDE.md | Always update both after adding/changing skills |
