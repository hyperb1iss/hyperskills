# Growth & Product

Ship features that grow and retain users.

## Quick Reference

### Product-Led Growth (PLG) Framework

**Time to Value < 15 minutes** - Users should hit their "aha" moment fast.

**PLG Pillars:**

1. **Freemium or free trial** - Let them try before buying
2. **Self-serve onboarding** - No sales call required
3. **Usage-based expansion** - Pay for what you use
4. **Built-in virality** - Product drives acquisition

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| Time to First Value | < 15 min |
| Activation Rate | > 40% |
| Day 1 Retention | > 50% |
| Week 1 Retention | > 25% |
| NPS | > 40 |

### Viral Loop Mechanics

**K-Factor Formula:** K = i × c

- i = invitations per user
- c = conversion rate of invites
- K > 1 = exponential growth

**Loop Types:**

1. **Incentivized Referrals**
   - Double-sided rewards (referrer + referee)
   - Reward tied to core product value
   - Example: "Refer a friend, both get $10"

2. **Content/UGC Loops**
   - User creates → shares externally → new users see → sign up
   - Example: TikTok watermarks, Canva designs

3. **Collaborative Loops**
   - Multi-user features require invites
   - Example: Figma team workspaces

### App Store Optimization (ASO)

**Title** (most important):

- Include primary keyword
- Brand name + value prop
- iOS: 30 chars, Android: 50 chars

**Keywords:**

- Long-tail > broad ("meditation for anxiety" > "meditation")
- Competitor names work but risky
- Update every 4-6 weeks based on performance

**Screenshots:**

- First 2-3 visible without scrolling
- Show core features, not onboarding
- Include social proof (ratings, awards)

**Conversion Factors:**

- Apps > 4.5 stars rank better
- Review velocity matters
- Reply to reviews (improves visibility)

### The 3-Second Rule (Video/TikTok)

63% of top-performing videos hook in 3 seconds.

**Hook Types:**
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Question | "Want to know why your app isn't growing?" |
| Contradiction | "Everyone says you need ads. Wrong." |
| Visual Surprise | Dramatic reaction, unexpected scene |
| Bold Statement | "This one metric changed everything" |

### Content Repurposing Flow

```
Long-form (Blog/Video)
    ↓
Short-form (Tweets, Reels, TikToks)
    ↓
Quotes/Carousels (LinkedIn, Instagram)
    ↓
Newsletter
    ↓
Podcast
```

One piece of content → 10+ distribution points.

### User Research Quick Methods

**5-Second Test:**
Show screenshot for 5 seconds, ask:

- What does this app do?
- Who is it for?
- What would you do first?

**Jobs-to-be-Done Interview:**

- "Tell me about the last time you [task]"
- "What were you trying to accomplish?"
- "What did you do before finding our product?"

**Fake Door Test:**
Add button/feature that doesn't exist yet, track clicks.

### Competitive Analysis Framework

```markdown
## Direct Competitors

| Feature      | Us  | Comp A | Comp B |
| ------------ | --- | ------ | ------ |
| Core feature | ✅  | ✅     | ❌     |
| Pricing      | $X  | $Y     | $Z     |
| Unique value | ... | ...    | ...    |

## Indirect Competitors

[Alternative solutions to same problem]

## Positioning Opportunity

[Gap in market we can own]
```

### A/B Testing Rules

1. **Test one thing** - Don't change 5 things at once
2. **Statistical significance** - Use proper sample sizes
3. **Run long enough** - Min 1-2 weeks, full business cycles
4. **Document everything** - Hypothesis → result → learning

**Sample Size Calculator:**

- 5% baseline conversion
- 20% minimum detectable effect
- 95% confidence
- **~1,500 visitors per variant**

### Growth Experiments Template

```markdown
## Experiment: [Name]

**Hypothesis:** If we [change], then [metric] will [improve/decrease] by [amount] because [reasoning].

**Metric:** [Primary metric to measure]
**Duration:** [X days/weeks]
**Traffic:** [% of users]

**Results:**

- Control: X%
- Variant: Y%
- Lift: Z%
- Significant: Yes/No

**Learnings:** [What we learned]
**Next Steps:** [Ship/iterate/kill]
```

### Micro-Influencer Strategy

| Tier  | Followers | Engagement | Cost/Post |
| ----- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Nano  | < 5K      | 3-5%       | $0-100    |
| Micro | 5K-50K    | 2-3%       | $100-500  |
| Mid   | 50K-500K  | 1.5-2%     | $500-5K   |

**5 nano-influencers > 1 mid-tier influencer** (same cost, 2x engagement)

### UGC Collection System

1. **Trigger moments** - Post-purchase, achievement, milestone
2. **Easy submission** - One-tap sharing, pre-filled templates
3. **Incentivize** - Features, discounts, recognition
4. **Curate & amplify** - Best UGC on your channels

UGC is **9.8x more impactful** than influencer content for purchases.
