- User problems (can't sleep, stress relief)

### 2. Expansion Methods

```markdown
## Keyword Sources

### App Store Suggestions
Type partial keywords in App Store search to see autocomplete

### Competitor Keywords
- Analyze top 10 competitors' metadata
- Use tools: AppTweak, Sensor Tower, AppFollow

### User Language
- Read competitor reviews for natural language
- Survey users about how they'd search

### Long-tail Keywords
- "meditation" → "meditation for anxiety"
- "budget app" → "budget tracker for couples"
```

### 3. Evaluation Matrix

| Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Relevance | Score |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|-------|
| [keyword] | High/Med/Low | 1-100 | 1-5 | Composite |

**Priority:** High volume + Low difficulty + High relevance

✓ First 2-3 screenshots visible without scrolling
✓ Portrait for phones, landscape for tablets
✓ Localize for key markets
✓ Test different orderings via A/B tests
```
